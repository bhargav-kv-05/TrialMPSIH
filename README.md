Mind Palace is a platform designed for students in higher education, to overcome their problems regarding mental health with a unique peer to peer support system. 
It aims to maintain privacy that is much needed among the teenagers in particular, who are in constant fear of judgement from others. 
It provides a safe space to share problems, leading to improvement in mental health, but it does not replace therapy or professional service. 
This is about learning to share their problems and get insights from others facing similar issues without fear of judgement.
